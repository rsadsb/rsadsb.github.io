## adsb_deku
- `no_std` support added, and many more improvements to the correctness of the message parsing

## rsadsb_common
- New library, with common code and data structures that are needed for creating your own `adsb_deku` ecosystem application
- This library also supports `no_std` environments

## rsadsb-embedded
We experimented on running our libraries for `no_std` environments, such as the [microbit v2](https://microbit.org/) and the [std32f3discovery](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32-discovery-kits.html).
You can find that code [here](https://github.com/wcampbell0x2a/rsadsb-embedded).
