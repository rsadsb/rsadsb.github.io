### Updates
Thank you to [@wiseman](https://github.com/wiseman) for helping me develop features.

- The Tab key can now be used to change the view to the pane. 
- Airplane display was added for a detailed display of all call signs, vertical speed, lat, long, and number of messages.
- Possible mis-decodes were reduced by reducing the trust of messages with a time gap.
- Dynamic Lat/Long positions are now possible if you have a gpsd server.
- Logging was added to `./logs` and can be controlled with the `RUST_LOG` env variable.
- A grayscale heatmap was added to the Coverage screen, giving the operator more detail on his sky coverage.

## adsb_deku (library)
The library itself was pretty stable for this release, just fixing some minor bugs with parsing and improving
the documentation.

The documentation for this release is [here](https://docs.rs/adsb_deku/0.4.0/adsb_deku/)

## dump1090
- The library is now styled in such a way that be tested from iq data, this will help prove the applications state
in the future.
- `--host` and `--port` were added to control TCP.
- A good amount of time was given to make sure the application was release ready, this gave us around 9% faster demodulation and decode.
